Overview of Changes from GLib 2.25.16 to GLib 2.25.17
=====================================================

The reduction of #include abuse that was made during the last release
had the side-effect of completely breaking the build when compiling
against the system-installed pcre library (see bug #629971).  This
release fixes that.

The Portuguese translation has also been updated.

Overview of Changes from GLib 2.25.15 to GLib 2.25.16
=====================================================

GApplication:
  GApplication, GAction and related classes have been removed from this
  release of glib.  There will -not- be a replacement for 2.26.0.

Build:
  - massive restructuring to reduce #include abuse
  - tweaks to silence some harmless compiler warnings
  - rename gschema-compile.c to glib-compile-schemas.c
  - Windows fixes
  - fix building with zlib < 1.2.4 on win32

GDateTime:
  - better msgctxt for translating month and weekday names
  - API is changed quite a lot, implementation is improved
  - GTimeZone is now exposed

GObject:
  - make ordering for overridden interface properties consistent
  - ->priv structures are limited to 64k but this was not documented,
    and exceeding this limit produced bad results.  Add docs and enforce
    the limit properly.

    properties in one go
  - improve debugging output for GValue containing G_TYPE_STRV

GIO:
  - fix priority sorting of GIO extensions
  - add GCredentials support on FreeBSD
  - fix support for IPv6 addresses in URI parsing functions
  - GSocketClient fixes for when g_socket_connect succeeds immediately
  - clarify string encoding for GFile constructors in docs
  - new functions g_data_input_stream_read_upto{,async,finish}
  - tweak confusing documentation for g_output_stream_write()

GDBus:
  - GDBusMessage can now be locked and copied (like in libdbus)
  - GDBusConnection filter function API has changed again
  - GDBusServer: ::new-connection now declares if the connection was claimed
  - add a partial workaround for GObject bug 627724.
  - very many memory leaks fixed

GVariant:
  - check for size == 0 in g_variant_get_bytestring to avoid a crash
    when attempting to get_bytestring() from an empty array
  - improve gobject-introspection annotations

GSettings:
  - add GSettings Windows registry backend
  - some internal tweaks to the backend API
  - remove g_settings_list_items
  - add g_settings_list_children and _list_keys to replace it
  - add schema compiler restrictions for dealing with lists
  - don't automatically emit value changed signals on writability
    changes

Other:
  - constify the 'parser' vtable param to g_markup_parse_context_push()
  - plug many memory leaks in test cases

Bugs closed:

Overview of Changes from GLib 2.25.12 to GLib 2.25.13
=====================================================

+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   WARNING: There have been no breaks in API or ABI.  Weird, eh?   |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+

The primary purpose of this release is to fix a serious problem with
glib 2.25.12: glibconfig.h (as generated on a Fedora amd64 system) was
being distributed in the tarball.  It was being used to build some parts
of glib on other systems (eg: 32bit ones).  This was causing some very
serious problems.

There have been many other improvements, however:

 Build and testing:
  - vastly improved test coverage
  - old tests moved to the gtester framework
  - gtester Makefile modified so that the tests only run once
  - cleanup of how we handle includes while building glib

 GVariant:
  - add a g_return_if_fail (utf8) to g_variant_new_string()

 GDBus:
  - perform extra sanity checks when serialising messages
  - add API to query and set the byteorder of a GDBusMessage
  - improve debug output, add some extra options
  - if exiting due to the bus disconnecting us, print an error message
    explaining why
  - sort property names correctly
  - don't bother sending RemoveMatch when we will close the connection
    anyway
  - use effective uid/gid for credential passing

 GSettings:
  - add G_SETTINGS_BIND_INVERT_BOOLEAN for inverting boolean bindings
    without mapping functions
  - mark all strings in the schema compiler for translation

 Binding:
  - improve closure support for bindings
  - copy GSettings INVERT_BOOLEAN flag

 Other:
  - fix another complicated GCancellable deadlock possibility

Bugs closed:
 599590 glib build doesn't look for correct pkg-config
 619026 avoid warning in gutils.h when using gcc with -Wconversion
 624739 Please fix POTFILES.in
 625472 Valgrind claims uninitialized bytes used
 625500 g_date_set_time_val documentation doesn't mention local time
 625628 GDBusProxy: wrong property name sorting
 625753 Incorrect flags used in g_dbus_connection_call_sync()
 625827 Expand documentation about error quark naming

Overview of Changes from GLib 2.25.11 to GLib 2.25.12
=====================================================

+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| WARNING: There have been many API changes in GDBus -- sending     |
| messages, subscribing to signals, closing connections and         |
| registering subtrees are affected.  The ABI for GSettingsBackend  |
| has also been changed.  For both reasons, a new dconf release is  |
| required (and will be along soon).                                |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+

Build:
  - cleanup automake setup
  - rename configure.in to configure.ac
  - various docs fixups
  - move glibconfig.h to glib/
  - disable dtrace support on Mac OS (which has incompatible 'dtrace')

GSettings:
  - add support for vendor override files (to change the default values
    in a schema)
  - change GSettingsBackend vtable
  - add g_settings_reset()
  - support binding to G_TYPE_STRV properties

GDBus:
  - many bug fixes, including a serialisation fix
  - stop handling incoming connections as soon as stop() is called
  - proper support for file descriptor passing
  - new flags parameter for sending messages
  - new flags parameter for subscribing to signals
  - always reset the message serial when sending a message unless
    G_DBUS_SEND_MESSAGE_FLAGS_PRESERVE_SERIAL is given
  - constness fixes for introspection structures
  - clean ups to subtree registration API

Other:
  - fix divide by zero bug in g_malloc_n functions
  - GIO: don't blindly assume that SOCK_CLOEXEC is supported
  - make GObject property notify freezes threadsafe
  - GIO: clean up credentials passing
  - GApplication: make default-quit not apply if register=FALSE
  - GIO: add annotations for gobject-introspection

Bugs closed:
 166020 use GAtomic for refcounting
 617483 Credentials passing
 622005 [GApplication] no way to modify the "default-quit" property
 623293 vendor override files
 623810 Message serialization bug
 623815 Don't check sender for GDBusProxy objects where name is not set
 624473 GDBusSubtreeIntrospectFunc return type
 624483 GDBusSubtreeEnumerateFunc clarification
 624484 GDBusSubtreeDispatchFunc clarification
 624754 gdbusaddress.c missing sys/wait.h

Overview of Changes from GLib 2.25.10 to GLib 2.25.11
=====================================================

+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| WARNING: There have been minor API changes in GDBus and GVariant. |
| These API changes will not affect many users, but they do require |
| a new version of GTK+ to be installed.                            |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+

Build:
  - add a --disable-Bsymbolic configure flag to disable linking with
    -Bsymbolic-functions
  - this release sees the complete removal of the old 'g*alias' hacks
  - honour the NOCONFIGURE environment variable from autogen.sh
  - use proper feature test macros for isnan
  - use pkg-config to check for zlib
  - add ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS to Makefile.am

GDBus:
  - hide Class and instance structures for all GDBus types except
    GDBusProxy.  This breaks API by preventing subclassing, but probably
    nobody was doing that.
  - add new GDBusConnection call to support flushing all pending
    outgoing messages
  - change the register_object API to add a reference to the
    GDBusInterfaceInfo object so the caller need not keep it alive
    themselves
  - don't rewrite the serial number when sending messages that already
    have a serial number
  - better error checking for DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS environment
    variable
  - switch to g_parse_debug_string for G_DBUS_DEBUG and add a lot of new
    flags
  - add support for temporarily freezing a freshly created
    GDBusConnection.  Do this until after the ::new-connection signal
    has finished running on GDBus services.
  - never require non-closed connections (the user is incapable of doing
    this due to the obvious race)
  - remove weird/misleading redundant check on NameOwnerChanged signal
  - emit GDBusProxy::g-properties-changed on NameOwnerChanged

GVariant:
  - the 'g_variant_{new,get}_byte_array' APIs have been removed
  - g_variant_{new,get,dup}_bytestring has been added, with different
    arguments and different behaviour
  - g_variant_{new,get,dup}_bytestring_array has been added, doing
    essentially the same thing as the 'strv' functions, but with byte
    strings instead of utf8 strings
  - G_VARIANT_TYPE_BYTESTRING ('ay'), BYTESTRING_ARRAY ('aay') and
    STRING_ARRAY ('as') constants have been added
  - the undocumented behaviour that g_variant_get_strv() deserialised
    arrays of object paths or signature strings has been dropped
  - additional varargs support for converting bytestrings or bytestring
    arrays with ^ay ^aay ^&ay and ^a&ay
  - improved gobject-introspection annotation
  - fix a problem with GBuffer calling g_slice_free for the wrong type
  - fix leaks in the type inferencing code of the parser

GSettings:
  - improved documentation
  - updated schema XML DTD, now xincluded into the docs
  - added support for schemas that extend other schemas (using the
    'extends=' attribute).  Values of keys in the base schema can be
    overridden using <override>.
  - added theoretical support for lists (using the 'list-of=' attribute)
  - lots of new tests
  - add support for flags (implemented similarly to enums)
  - add support for generating .enums.xml files to gsettings.m4:
      gsettings_ENUM_NAMESPACE = org.example.myapp
      gsettings_ENUM_FILES = ../path/to/*.h
    will generate org.example.myapp.enums.xml with mappings for all
    enums and flags in the specified .h files.
  - warn with g_message() if the 'memory' backend is used by default
    (ie: because no other GSettings backends are installed)
  - fix get_property() for GSettings::schema
  - command line tool: fix a bug that prevented non-basic values from
    being set due to a premature free
  - command line tool: bash completion support
  - chain up in _finalize
  - add a new g_settings_get_mapped API to read settings that require
    post-processing
  - retry with the translated or schema default value if the
    GSettingsBindGetMapping function fails
  - schema compiler: never fail due to empty schema directories (but
    warn)
  - peek rather than ref/unref the GEnumClass in the mapping function
  - schema compiler: compile *.enums.xml before *.gschemas.xml to ensure
    that we have all the enums that the schemas may reference
  - schema compiler: improve accuracy of line numbers in error reports
  - fix crashes in the keyfile backend caused by invalid group names in
    the keyfile

Other:
  - always intern GBinding prop names
  - base64: remove asserts preventing conversion of empty strings
  - document NULL special-cases for GValueArray
  - GNode docs improvements
  - improve detection of 'system internal' mounts
  - fix leaks in the inotify GFileMonitor implementation
  - annotate all custom GIO GSources to improve debugging (e.g. using
    SystemTap)

Tests:
  - Turn on glibc malloc checking features for make check
  - improvements for GSettings tests, plus new tests
  - improved tests for GKeyfile
  - new tests for GDir, GSList, GSList, GAppLaunchContext,
    CharsetConverter, GIcon, ...
  - move some tests to GTester (tree tests, uri tests)
  - generally, really an awful lot of new tests
  - don't try to allocate 2gigs of memory anymore for the array test

 552363 g_value_array_{insert,prepend,append}'s special cases for NULL
 561248 Improve return value description from g_node_prev/next_sibling()
 570036 Add ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS to Makefile.am
 576833 g_sprintf add a reference to g_strdup_printf
 576854 g_strconcat() documentation should provide a hint about bad l10n
 582227 reference: add other URI functions to 'URI Functions' section
 599223 should provide g_spawn_* variants that take a GAppLaunchContext
 610784 array test failing
 613057 Leak in inotify GFileMonitor implementation
 620536 Annotate all custom GIO GSource using g_source_set_name
 620913 More control with G_DBUS_DEBUG
 622124 implement flags
 622127 GSettings extended key validation
 622128 retry with default value for failed mapping
 622294 More annotations for GVariant
 622565 glib-compile-schemas fails when no schemas
 622600 Fix missing prototype warning
 622813 gsettings mapping & enum buglet
 623142 Ensure ::new-connection runs before processing D-Bus messages
 623143 Never require non-closed connections
 623319 use g_parse_debug_string for dbus debug flags
 623401 process enums first
 623402 schema compiler reports wrong line numbers
 623407 g_keyfile_settings_backend_new crashes with the key "/"
 623473 zlib should be checked with pkg-config
 623537 GDBusProxy has weird checking on NameOwnerChanged
 623538 GDBusProxy::g-properties-changed emission for corner cases
 623692 directory with file at multiple MLS levels may display empty
 623720 gschema.dtd does not contain enum definitions

Overview of Changes from GLib 2.25.8 to GLib 2.25.9
===================================================

+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| WARNING: There have been API changes in GDBus, GSettings and   |
| GApplication. Users of these APIs will need to be adapted. In  |
| particular, a new release of GTK+ is required to go along with |
| this one.                                                      |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+

* GDBus
 - Use Gio's default async implementation
 - Fix proxy construction for objects with no properties
 - Fix error handling in synchronous initialization
 - Do not dispatch calls to unregistered objects
 - Add _with_closures alternative functions
 - Allow constructing GDBusProxy with well-known names
 - Remove GType parameters from GDBusProxy constructors
 - Nuke g_bus_watch_proxy API
 - Add --xml to gdbus-tool to print raw introspected XML

* GSettings
 - schema file format change: store (default, options) in gvdb

===================================================

* GIO:
 - GConverter: a generic interface for stateful conversions of data,
   suitable for charset conversion, compression, decompression, regexp
   replacement. Concrete implementations are GCharsetConverter,
   GZlibCompressor and GZlibDecompressor. GConverterInputStream,
   GConverterOutputStream are stream implementations that convert data
   while loading or saving it.
 - GMounts can now have a 'default location': a path that reflects
   the main entry point for the user (e.g. the home directory).
 - As a consequence of the compression support, GIO depends on zlib now.

* GObject:
 - G_IMPLEMENT_INTERFACE_DYNAMIC: a convenience macro for adding
   interfaces to dynamic types.

   it is not generally permissible to load modules that are linked
   against libpthread if the program has not been compiled with threading
   support.

Overview of Changes from GLib 2.20.x to GLib 2.21.0
===================================================

* GIO:
 - New helper functions g_cancellable_connect/disconnect to avoid
   race conditions when connecting to the "cancelled" signal on
   GCancellable.
 - New types and methods for dealing with IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (and
   UNIX domain socket addresses under UNIX). This does not include code
   for actual socket I/O.
 - GResolver provides asynchronous and cancellable APIs for resolving
   hostnames, reverse lookup of IP addresses and resolving SRV records.

* Glib now provides hash and comparison functions for int64 and double
  types, suitable for use with GHashTable.

* GArray, GPtrArray and GByteArray can be ref counted now, and have
  boxed types.

Overview of Changes from GLib 2.18.1 to GLib 2.19.0
===================================================

* Rewrite GHashTable to use open addressing with quadratic probing instead 
  of chaining. This has the potential to reduce memory fragmentation 
  significantly, while being slightly faster due to better locality and 
  no need to call alloc/free functions for nodes. Benchmarks suggest it 
  also uses less memory overall.

* Make g_poll available as public api

* New macros g_assert_error and g_assert_no_error to assert 
  that a GError is set or unset

* g_cancellable_make_pollfd: New method to make a GPollFD for a cancellable

* g_app_info_can_delete, g_app_info_delete, g_app_info_reset_type_associations:
  New functions to clean up app infos and content types

* When launching applications, always pass fuse file:// uris when possible,
  and let gio convert such uris back to gio uris.

* Bugs fixed:
 505361 gunixinputstream.c assumes poll() available

Overview of Changes from GLib 2.14.x to GLib 2.15.0
===================================================

Major new features:

 * GIO: a VFS API, designed to replace GnomeVFS. The GIO implementation 
   in GLib has support for local filesystems. The new, separate gvfs 
   module contains various backend implementations (cifs, ftp, sftp,
   http, ...)

 * GChecksum: provides various hash algorithms, such as MD5, SHA-1
   and SHA-256
 
 * GTest: a test framework 
 
Smaller additions:

 * GHash:
 - GHash has iterators, as an alternative to g_hash_table_foreach

 * GMarkup: 
 - g_markup_parse_context_get_element_stack: New function to
   get the stack of open elements
 - G_MARKUP_PREFIX_ERROR_POSITION: New flag to improve error
   reporting
 - g_markup_collect_attributes: Convenience function for handling
   attributes

* GKeyFile: 
 - Functions that take a GError now return a boolean to indicate 
   success, instead of void
 - Various performance improvements

* GAsyncQueue:
 - g_async_queue_new_full: new function that allows to specify
   a free function for leftover elements
 
* GError:
 - g_prefix_error and g_propagate_prefixed_error: New functions
   to ease error propagation

* Internationalization:
 - C_: A new 2-argument variant of the Q_() macro 
 - Use native character set conversion API on Windows

* GLib builds with automake 1.10

Overview of Changes from GLib 2.8.x to GLib 2.9.0
=================================================
* Unicode support:
 - The Unicode tables have been updated to Unicode 4.1, 
   adding several new values to the GUnicodeBreakType 
   enumeration. This breaks Pango <= 1.10 
   [Behdad Esfahbod]
 - The various Unicode character predicate functions 
   (g_unichar_isalpha, g_unichar_isdigit,...) have
   been optimized
   [Behdad]
 - g_utf8_pointer_to_offset, g_utf8_offset_to_pointer:
   These functions handle negative offsets now, and
   going backwards in g_utf8_offset_to_pointer uses
   "stutter stepping".
   [Larry Ewing, Matthias Clasen]

* Memory management:
 - Mem chunks are no longer used internally in GLib and
   GObject. GMemChunk will be deprecated in GLib 2.10
 - All APIs based on GAllocator (g_list_push/pop_allocator,
   and similar push/pop_allocator functions for other
   data structures) have been deprecated, since they
   never worked as intended.
 - The g_slice_* functions have been added as a 
   new API for fast allocation of small memory blocks. 
   The implementation in GLib 2.9.0 is just a simple 
   wrapper around malloc. GLib 2.10 will have an
   efficient and scalable implementation. 
   [Tim Janik, Matthias]

* Pattern matching:
 - g_pattern_match has been optimized to avoid
   unnecessary recursion.
   [Tim, Matthias]

* g_intern_string, g_intern_static_string: 
 - New functions to intern strings. These are now used 
   by GObject to avoid duplicating static strings 
   [Matthias]

* g_thread_foreach: 
 - New function to iterate over all GThreads 
   [Tim, Matthias]

* g_date_set_time_t, g_date_set_time_val:
 - New functions to set a GDate from a time_t or
   GTimeVal value. g_date_set_time has been deprecated 
   in favor of these.
   [Roger Leigh]

* g_snprintf and g_vsnprintf:
 - These functions are no longer declared in gprintf.h, 
   since they are in glib.h
