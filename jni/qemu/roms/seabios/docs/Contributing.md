SeaBIOS welcomes contributions of code (either fixing bugs or adding
new functionality). At a high level, the process to contribute a
change is:

1. [Obtain](Download) the current code and documentation
2. Enhance and test the code locally
3. Submit changes to the SeaBIOS [mailing list](Mailinglist) as a
   patch
4. Receive feedback, answer questions, and possibly provide updated
   patches
5. When accepted, a maintainer (Kevin O'Connor or Gerd Hoffman) will
   commit the change to the master SeaBIOS repository

The SeaBIOS patch submission process is similar to the
[QEMU process](http://wiki.qemu.org/Contribute/SubmitAPatch). Please
review the QEMU process for more details and tips on the best way to
submit patches. The SeaBIOS C code does follow a slightly different
coding style from QEMU (eg, mixed code and C99 style variable
declarations are encouraged, braces are not required around single
statement blocks), however patches in the QEMU style are acceptable.
