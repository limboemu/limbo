.TH DWEBP 1 "May 10, 2013"
.SH NAME
dwebp \- decompress a WebP file to an image file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dwebp
.RI [ options ] " input_file.webp
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents the
.B dwebp
command.
.PP
\fBdwebp\fP decompresses WebP files into PNG, PAM, PPM or PGM images.
.SH OPTIONS
The basic options are:
.TP
.B \-h
Print usage summary.
.TP
.B \-version
Print the version number (as major.minor.revision) and exit.
.TP
.BI \-o " string
Specify the name of the output file (as PNG format by default).
.TP
.B \-bmp
Change the output format to uncompressed BMP.
.TP
.B \-tiff
Change the output format to uncompressed TIFF.
.TP
.B \-pam
Change the output format to PAM (retains alpha).
.TP
.B \-ppm
Change the output format to PPM (discards alpha).
.TP
.B \-pgm
Change the output format to PGM. The output consists of luma/chroma
samples instead of RGB, using the ICM4 layout. This option is mainly
for verification and debugging purposes.
.TP
.B \-yuv
Change the output format to raw YUV. The output consists of
luma/chroma-U/chroma-V samples instead of RGB, saved sequentially as
individual planes. This option is mainly for verification and debugging
purposes.
.TP
.B \-nofancy
Don't use the fancy upscaler for YUV420. This may lead to jaggy
edges (especially the red ones), but should be faster.
.TP
.B \-nofilter
Don't use the in-loop filtering process even if it is required by
the bitstream. This may produce visible blocks on the non-compliant output,
but will make the decoding faster.
.TP
.B \-mt
Use multi-threading for decoding, if possible.
.TP
.BI \-crop " x_position y_position width height
Crop the decoded picture to a rectangle with top-left corner at coordinates
(\fBx_position\fP, \fBy_position\fP) and size \fBwidth\fP x \fBheight\fP.
This cropping area must be fully contained within the source rectangle.
The top-left corner will be snapped to even coordinates if needed.
This option is meant to reduce the memory needed for cropping large images.
Note: the cropping is applied \fIbefore\fP any scaling.
.TP
.BI \-scale " width height
Rescale the decoded picture to dimension \fBwidth\fP x \fBheight\fP. This
option is mostly intended to reducing the memory needed to decode large images,
when only a small version is needed (thumbnail, preview, etc.).  Note: scaling
is applied \fIafter\fP cropping.
.TP
.B \-v
Print extra information (decoding time in particular).
.TP
.B \-noasm
Disable all assembly optimizations.
