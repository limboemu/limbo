MultiCore without KVM (recent phone (Snapdragon 845 have 8 cores)
Graphics Drivers (3D acceleration?) (VMWare?) (DirectX?) (-> Limbo can become a system and old game emulator if this option is available! But only on recent devices)
More RAM (adaptative spinner for RAM selection depending on the availaible RAM on the device?)
Disk/virtual CD containing a driver setup for quick and easy installation (Windows / Linux) if they are not present. (GPU/Sound/Ethernet etc...)
Disk Cleanup option, which removes unused space from the virtual disk that occupies space on the phone's storage. 
  - Example: ImageType: 20GB Growable, Used: 6GB, FileSize: 9GB (-> The clean option will change the file size to 6GB)
